# Fashion Pricing & Value Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyses fashion product data to evaluate pricing strategies, customer-perceived quality, and value positioning across brands and categories. The goal is to understand whether higher-priced products deliver better quality and to identify opportunities for better value offerings.

The analysis is designed to support business decision-making in pricing, merchandising, and brand positioning and will be visualised using **Power BI**.

---

## Business Questions
The project focuses on the following key business questions:

1. Does paying more for fashion products result in better customer-perceived quality?
2. Which brands offer the best value products based on price and customer ratings?
3. Which product categories are most affected by overpricing?
4. Are premium-priced products consistently delivering higher customer satisfaction?
5. How is product availability distributed across sizes and categories?
6. Where do pricing inefficiencies present opportunities for improvement?

## Dataset
**Source:** Kaggle – Fashion Products Dataset  
The dataset includes product-level information such as:
- Product and brand details
- Category, size, and colour
- Price and customer ratings
- User IDs

---

## Data Preparation
The dataset was cleaned and enhanced using Excel prior to visualisation. Key preparation steps included:
- Creating price tiers (Budget, Mid, Premium) based on product price
- Engineering flag variables to identify:
  - Best value products (high rating, lower price)
  - Overpriced products (high price, low rating)
- Validating rating distributions and removing inconsistencies

---

## Key Metrics & Features
- **Average Rating**
- **Average Price**
- **Price Tier (Budget / Mid / Premium)**
- **Best Value Flag**
- **Overpriced Flag**
- **Product Count by Brand, Category, and Size**

---

## Key Insights
- Higher prices do not significantly correlate with higher customer ratings.
- Premium products show only marginally higher average ratings compared to budget products.
- Certain high-volume products (e.g. T-shirts and shoes) show higher levels of overpricing.
- Some brands consistently offer better value, balancing affordability with customer satisfaction.
- Product availability across sizes is evenly distributed, indicating balanced inventory coverage.

## Power BI Dashboard (In Progress)
The Power BI dashboard will include:
- Brand positioning (price vs rating)
- Overpriced vs best-value product analysis
- Price tier performance comparison
- Category-level pricing insights
- Interactive filters by brand, category, and price tier

---

## Tools Used
- Excel (data cleaning, feature engineering, pivot analysis)
- Power BI (dashboard design and visualisation)
- GitHub (project documentation and version control)

---

## Project Purpose
This project demonstrates analytical thinking, data storytelling, and business insight generation using real-world product data. It is intended as a portfolio project for data analyst and business analyst roles.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add time-based pricing trends (if data becomes available)
- Incorporate customer segmentation analysis
- Extend analysis with SQL or Python for scalability
