# Rankings of Priority for Cybersecurity Among Respondents

## Project overview

This project analyses UK survey data to understand how different demographic groups prioritise cyber security in their personal lives. The focus is on transforming a complex government survey cross-tabulation into a clean, reporting-ready dataset and using SQL to generate clear, decision-focused insights.

The analysis is designed to mirror the type of work carried out in **Risk Data & Reporting** and **Data & Performance Analyst** roles within the public sector.

## Objectives

* Clean and normalise survey data originally presented as Excel cross-tabs
* Create a single master fact table suitable for SQL and BI tools
* Use SQL to rank and compare cyber security priority across demographic groups
* Apply reporting rules (e.g. minimum base sizes) to ensure robust insights

---

## Data

* **Source:** UK cyber security attitudes survey (aggregated, weighted results)
* **Unit of analysis:** Demographic group (e.g. age, gender, education)
* **Key metric:** Percentage of respondents rating cyber security as a *fairly or very high priority*

The final dataset is stored as `Master_Tbl.csv` and contains one row per demographic segment.

### Final table structure

* `demographic_type` – Category of demographic (Age, Gender, Education)
* `demographic_group` – Specific group within the category
* `high_priority_pct` – Percentage rating cyber security as high priority
* `weighted_base` – Weighted sample size for the group
* `Priority_strength` – Derived categorisation of priority level

## Methodology

1. **Data cleaning (Python / pandas)**

   * Removed Excel-generated artefacts (empty columns, helper columns)
   * Dropped non-analytical and blank rows
   * Validated completeness of KPI and base values

2. **Data modelling**

   * Structured the cleaned data as a single fact table (`Master_Tbl`)
   * Designed the table to be compatible with SQL querying and BI tools

3. **SQL analysis (SQLite via Python)**

   * Used `WHERE` clauses to isolate specific demographics (e.g. age groups)
   * Applied base-size thresholds to exclude statistically unreliable segments
   * Ranked demographic groups by cyber security priority
   * Used `GROUP BY` to summarise performance across demographic types
   * Demonstrated dimensional modelling through a simple `JOIN`

---

## Key findings

* Cyber security is a high personal priority for the majority of respondents, but prioritisation varies across demographic groups
* Older age groups consistently report higher prioritisation than younger groups
* Education level shows variation, suggesting differences in awareness or exposure
* Applying minimum base-size rules improves the reliability of reported insights

## Tools and technologies

* Excel
* Python (pandas)
* SQL (SQLite executed within a Python environment)
* Kaggle Notebook

## Repository contents

* `Cybersecurity_Priority.ipynb` – Kaggle notebook containing data cleaning, SQL analysis, and commentary
* `Master_Tbl.csv` – Cleaned, analysis-ready dataset
* `screenshots/` – Key outputs used for quick review in this README
* `README.md` – Project documentation

---

## Next steps

* Incorporate additional survey questions (e.g. perceived cyber risk, confidence in government response)
* Expand the fact table to support multi-metric reporting
* Build an interactive Power BI dashboard using the same data model
