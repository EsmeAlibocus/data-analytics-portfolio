# Supply Chain Risk & Profitability Analysis (SQL)

## Overview
This project analyses supplier performance by combining profitability metrics
with operational risk indicators. Using SQL, the analysis identifies suppliers
that generate above-average gross profit while also presenting elevated quality
and reliability risks.

The goal is to demonstrate how data analysis can support more informed supply
chain and sourcing decisions by balancing cost efficiency with operational
resilience.

## Business Problem
Supply chains often prioritise low cost and high profitability without fully
accounting for supplier risk. This project explores whether high-profit
suppliers also introduce quality or reliability concerns that could threaten
overall supply chain performance.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains simulated supply chain data, including:
- Supplier information
- Product categories
- Gross profit
- Quality inspection results
- Defect rates
- On-time delivery indicators
- Logistics and transportation details

The data was cleaned and prepared for SQL analysis using Excel.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (SQLite)** – core analysis and KPI derivation  
- **Excel** – data loading, cleaning and preparation  
- **PowerBi** - Dashboard, visual analysis 

---

## Key Metrics & KPIs
- Gross Profit
- On-Time Delivery Rate
- Quality Pass Rate
- Defect Rate
- Supplier Risk Rate (derived dynamically)
- Perfect Order Rate (On-time AND Quality Pass)

---

## Analysis Approach
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset for SQL compatibility  
2. Derived supplier risk dynamically using inspection results and defect thresholds  
3. Aggregated profitability and risk metrics at supplier level  
4. Used `CASE WHEN`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses to identify:
   - High-profit suppliers
   - High-risk suppliers
   - Suppliers that meet both conditions  

---

## Key Insights
- High profitability does not always correlate with operational reliability.
- A small subset of suppliers generate above-average gross profit while also
  exhibiting elevated supplier risk rates.
- Supplier risk is primarily driven by inspection failures and higher defect
  rates rather than delivery delays alone.

---

## Recommendations
- Prioritise suppliers that balance high gross profit with low supplier risk.
- Conduct quality audits for suppliers with supplier risk rates above 50%.
- Introduce supplier scorecards combining profitability and operational KPIs
  to guide sourcing decisions.

---

## Assumptions & Limitations
- Supplier risk was defined using inspection failures and a defect rate
  threshold of 3%.
- The dataset represents historical performance and does not include external
  disruptions or demand volatility.
- Results should be validated with live operational data before implementation.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL aggregations (`SUM`, `AVG`)
- `CASE WHEN` logic
- `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses
- Subqueries
- KPI creation and interpretation
- Translating business problems into analytical solutions
